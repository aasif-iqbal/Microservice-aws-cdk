## What is infrastructure as code.

### **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) – Explained**  

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure (like servers, databases, and networks) using **machine-readable configuration files** instead of manual processes.  

---

## **🔹 Why Use IaC?**
Traditionally, infrastructure was **set up manually** through cloud consoles or command-line tools. This led to:  
❌ **Inconsistencies** – Different environments (dev, staging, production) had slight variations.  
❌ **Manual Errors** – Human mistakes during setup.  
❌ **Slow Scaling** – Hard to replicate environments quickly.  

IaC **solves** these issues by **automating** infrastructure deployment using code.

---

## **🔹 How IaC Works**
1️⃣ **Write Infrastructure Code** – Define servers, networks, databases in a code file (e.g., YAML, JSON, HCL).  
2️⃣ **Store Code in Version Control** – Use Git to track infrastructure changes.  
3️⃣ **Apply Code to Deploy Infrastructure** – Use tools like Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, or Ansible to create/update infrastructure.  
4️⃣ **Manage Infrastructure as Software** – Modify configurations by updating the code and redeploying.  

---

## **🔹 Types of IaC**
### **1️⃣ Declarative (Desired State)**
- **Describe what the final infrastructure should look like.**
- The system automatically determines how to achieve that state.  
- Example: **Terraform, AWS CloudFormation**  
- ✅ Easier to maintain and track.  

**Example (Terraform):**  
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```
This code **declares** that an AWS EC2 instance **must exist** with the given settings.

### **2️⃣ Imperative (Step-by-Step)**
- **Define step-by-step commands** to create infrastructure.  
- Example: **Ansible, Bash scripts**  
- ✅ More control over execution.  

**Example (Ansible Playbook):**  
```yaml
- name: Install Apache
  hosts: web_servers
  tasks:
    - name: Install package
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
```
This script **executes steps** to install Apache on a server.

## **🔹 Popular IaC Tools**
| Tool               | Type         | Used For |
|--------------------|-------------|----------|
| **Terraform**      | Declarative | Multi-cloud automation |
| **AWS CloudFormation** | Declarative | AWS-specific infrastructure |
| **Ansible**       | Imperative  | Configuration management |
| **Pulumi**        | Declarative | IaC with programming languages like TypeScript/Python |

---

## **🔹 Benefits of IaC**
✅ **Automation** – No need for manual setup.  
✅ **Consistency** – Identical environments across teams.  
✅ **Scalability** – Deploy infrastructure quickly.  
✅ **Version Control** – Track changes using Git.  
✅ **Cost-Efficient** – Reduces human errors and downtime.  

---

## **🔹 Example Use Case**
### **Deploying an AWS Server with Terraform**
1. Install Terraform.  
2. Write `main.tf`:
   ```hcl
   provider "aws" {
     region = "us-east-1"
   }

   resource "aws_instance" "web" {
     ami           = "ami-123456"
     instance_type = "t2.micro"
   }
   ```
3. Run the deployment:  
   ```sh
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

## **🔹 Conclusion**
**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is a key practice in **DevOps** and **Cloud Automation**, making infrastructure **repeatable, scalable, and error-free**.

### **What is AWS CDK?**  
AWS **Cloud Development Kit (CDK)** is an **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool that lets you define AWS infrastructure using **modern programming languages** like **TypeScript, Python, Java, Go, and C#**, instead of writing YAML/JSON templates (as in CloudFormation).  

---

### **Where does AWS CDK fit in Microservices?**  
AWS CDK helps in **automating infrastructure deployment** in a **microservices architecture**, ensuring repeatability, scalability, and maintainability.  

📌 **It fits well in:**  
✔ **Deploying microservices** (Lambda, ECS, EKS, API Gateway)  
✔ **Provisioning databases** (DynamoDB, RDS, S3, Elasticsearch)  
✔ **Configuring networking** (VPCs, Security Groups, Load Balancers)  
✔ **Setting up monitoring** (CloudWatch, X-Ray, Prometheus)  
✔ **Automating CI/CD** (CodePipeline, CodeBuild, GitHub Actions)  

📌 **Example Use Case in Microservices:**  
- **Each microservice** (user-service, order-service) has its own infrastructure.  
- **AWS CDK** helps define and deploy the required **Lambda functions, DynamoDB tables, and API Gateway endpoints** for each microservice **automatically**.

### **Why Use AWS CDK? (Advantages over CloudFormation & Terraform)**
| Feature            | AWS CDK 🏆  | CloudFormation 📜  | Terraform 🌍 |
|--------------------|------------|--------------------|-------------|
| **Language Support** | TypeScript, Python, Java, Go, C# | YAML/JSON | HCL |
| **Code Reusability** | ✅ Functions, Classes | ❌ Repeats YAML Code | ✅ Modules |
| **Ease of Use** | ✅ High | ❌ Complex | ✅ Medium |
| **AWS Native** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Multi-Cloud Support** | ❌ AWS-only | ❌ AWS-only | ✅ Yes |

⏩ **Best for AWS-based microservices projects** due to deep AWS integration.

### **AWS CDK Example (Node.js TypeScript)**
Let's deploy an **AWS Lambda function** with an **API Gateway** using CDK:

#### **1️⃣ Install AWS CDK CLI**
```sh
npm install -g aws-cdk
```

#### **2️⃣ Initialize a CDK Project**
```sh
mkdir my-microservice && cd my-microservice
cdk init app --language=typescript
```

#### **3️⃣ Install Required Dependencies**
```sh
npm install @aws-cdk/aws-lambda @aws-cdk/aws-apigateway
```

#### **4️⃣ Define the Stack (`lib/microservice-stack.ts`)**
```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as lambda from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda';
import * as apigateway from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-apigateway';

export class MicroserviceStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Create a Lambda function
    const myLambda = new lambda.Function(this, 'MyLambdaFunction', {
      runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
      handler: 'index.handler',
      code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('lambda'),
    });

    // API Gateway to trigger Lambda
    new apigateway.LambdaRestApi(this, 'MyApiGateway', {
      handler: myLambda,
    });
  }
}
```

#### **5️⃣ Deploy the Infrastructure**
```sh
cdk synth   # Synthesize CloudFormation template
cdk deploy  # Deploy to AWS
```

### **Conclusion: When to Use AWS CDK?**
✅ **Best for AWS-based microservices** where you need automated, repeatable infrastructure  
✅ **Easier than CloudFormation** (because of TypeScript/Python support)  
✅ **Works well with DevOps pipelines** (CI/CD, GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline)  
❌ **Not ideal for multi-cloud** (for that, use Terraform)
